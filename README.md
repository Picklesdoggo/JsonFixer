# JsonFixer

A quick and dirty way to fix broken JSON files, steps for use:

1. Navigate to Vault directory
2. Delete "DELTEME.txt"
3. Place all broken JSON files in Vault directory (I recommend making a backup)
4. Run application
5. Type in broken objectID
6. Navigate to Vault directory typically C:\Users\XXX\Documents\My Games\H3VR\Vault\Objects\BareObjects
7. Replace broken JSON files with FIXED versions
8. Rename files to match original broken files, removing word FIXED.
